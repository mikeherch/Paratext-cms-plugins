# Paratext-cms-plugins
The Paratext application (produced by SIL/UBS) has an API for executing Python scripts from within Paratext. This repository contains scripts that can be executed in this environment. For information on Paratext software go to https://pt8.paratext.org

In this collection are three apps developed for use in the PNG branch of PBT. They are designed to be used Paratext books that are formatted according to the Standard for Literacy Content in Paratext.

* Show Shellbooks Text – This app will produce a report in plain text showing one or more shell books or original stories without SFM markers (\ codes).
* Show Shellbooks Link Index – This app will display a chapter-verse index of shellbooks or original stories in a Paratext window. If you double-click on an item in the list, Paratext will jump to that chapter and verse.
* Shellbooks To Publisher – This app will produce a report showing one or more Shell Books formatted specifically for copying and pasting text into Publisher shells. It has been optimized for pasting text into Publisher’s linked text boxes by replacing page numbers in the report with page breaks recognizable by Publisher. (The app does not copy the text into Publisher for you. It just makes the manual copying easier.)
